 The game proposed for this coursework is called "The Road Layer".
It is a one player game and involves stacking layers of a road in order to create the longest road.
There will be a crane arm swing ing left-right with a block of road attached to it, the player has to press a specific key to release the block at a specific time in order to align it perfectly with the road on the ground.
If the blocks are not aligned perfectly the threshold will dissappear. The game is a different version of “Tower Block Game” but instead of tower blocks the user has road layouts and the user needs  to fit in the new blocks with the old one to create the longest road instead of the tallest building.
	The game will have different levels. Each level up will increase the speed of the hanging  blocks. Another feature that can be implemented is to make also the blocks on the ground to move at a higher level.
	The website has 4 pages (please see attached). All pages are based on Bootstrap framework. The homepage with a canvas where the game will be implemented in Javascript. 
	In order to play users need to create an account through “Register” page. Then if the users want to play again they can simply login in the “Login/Logout” page. Users details will be stored in HTML 5 Local Storage in JSON format along with the score which will be displayed on	 the leaderboard page(makes the user want to play again to beat other users highscore or own score).
All pages include a footer and a navigation bar added to the website using PHP.
